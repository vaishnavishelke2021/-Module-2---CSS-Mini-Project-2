Module 2 - CSS mini project 2 (Heritage Website)
Mini Project 2 from Module 2, is extended by applying CSS features. I have created this project using html and css properties as per the coursebook instructions provided by Talent Battle. Here the internal CSS is used for each page.

Note : the projects are not responsive, responsive projects will be uploaded in bootstrap module.
